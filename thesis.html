                <a name="Abstract"><h2>Abstract</h2></a>
                <p>I completed the following in fulfilment of the requirements for my graduate Master of Science program in Integrated Digital Media at NYU Poly.  I received my degree in May 2013.  The project concerns itself with the creation of a multicultural marketing vehicle by way of a digital/mobile media channel that is aligned with the proven advanced digital media usage habits of minorities, gays and blacks. In my paper, I explore a variety of psychological research and media audits to discuss the dismal treatment of young men of color in the media and the proven sub conscious effects of these images on whites (and the whitened) in regards to hiring, voting, shooting young men of color randomly in the street, subsequent murder trial verdicts... </p>

                <p>I compare the negative media treatment of minority men of color with the inclusive and identity affirming media treatment of gays in order to justify a media outlet that attempts to redefine the American male mainstream in the face of our rapidly changing population demographic. My thesis then goes on to explore a variety of marketing data compiled from sources including AdAge, Global Hue, Google, e-marketer.com, The Heinz Foundation et al... to expound on the the vitality of the African American and gay consumer market and the necessity for new digital media channels that meet their usage habits and hearken to their particular consumer interests.</p>

                <p>In creating this channel, men of color would then enjoy the media legitimacy (and subsequent political/social benefits) and minority identity affirmation that gays have been able to achieve in recent years, and advertisers would have a means of accessing literally trillions of dollars of untapped economy.  I then go on to explain and present a UX design for a web site that I have begun to prototype in wordpress called BROTHER.</p>

                <p>Along with scouring a variety of scholarly articles concerning media representation of young men of color and gay men, I spent several months digesting a vareity of marketing statistics conerning digital media usage, education, earnings and good consumption habits of African Americans, Latinos and Gays.  In an effort to corroborate some of this information I sought out feedback from several of my peers by way of a brief survey.  Please feel free to access it <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/10Lk0XG">here</a>.</p>
                <p>I used this feedback in conjunction with my research and some sources regarding preliminary UX research and design to create a set of fictitious personas that would allow me to get a better grasp of the user goals, design aesthetic, and content requirements that were unique to my particular endeavor.</p>

                <p>For my logo, I referenced old slave auction bills and tried to find contemporary fonts that were similar to the types of typography that was used by typographers in antebellum America.  Given the nature of my thesis and its main purpose as a marketing vehicle for minority American men, I thought that it would be a witty and apt to appropriate this rich though sordid typographical history into my site.</p>

                <p>My final logo incorporated seven different fonts (Bodidly, Bodoni, IFCRailroad, Rosewood, Showboat, OldNewspaperType, and LTNutshell) all of which were very similar the look of the typography in the Antebellum advertisements. The lack of uniformity in the type served to underscore the idea of homogenieity and ownership of our multicultural American History.  Themes that were very important in the construction of my editorial philosophy and the construction of my thesis in general.</p>

                <p>My UX required quite a bit of planning and ressearch.  I leaned hevily on the texts of <a href=http://www.jjg.net/elements/>Jesse James Garrett</a> and his particular approach to UX planning and the flow of information.  His text, The Elements of User Experience, was a great help to me throughout the entire design and ideation process.</p>

                <p>Below you will find some of my initial idea boards as well as the information flow that I create in Omnigraffle to describe how my site would work. My initial plan was to feature all content by way of modals that would allow the user to never have to leave the homepage essentially.  Features would pop up in a lightbox or shadowbox modal format above the main page content.  Links to similar stories would be offered in the pop up or the user could simply navigate back to the home page to check out more stories by clicking outside of the modal. In my design, I tried to designate advertising spaces with blue boxes.</p>

                <p>I drew inspiration from my design from the streamlined look of some of the more popular mens fashion publications like VMan, and Hypbeast. I appreciated in particular the categorization and infinite scroll functionality of the VMan site and tried to create an interface that would be friendly to this type of navigation. I envisioned that initial content for my site would be either syndicated fashion, lifestyle and tech content in coordination with original street fashion photographs of young gay and black men.  This in itself is a very simple way to begin to publish positive images of both minorities.</p>

                <p>I was able to create a prorotype in WordPress using the theme Cubrik and a few street fashion shots that I took of stylish gentlemen on the streets of New York.  I am still working on the project but in the meantime you can access the prototype <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
