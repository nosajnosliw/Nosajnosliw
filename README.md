This is a portfolio site that I deisgned and coded using HTML5, CSS, 
Javascript and the Shadowbox.js and Processing.js libraries.

I have linked a variety of my UX, Photography, Graphic Design and other Creative
work to this site.  I'm hoping to reiterate it using the material design thinking
and Materialism css framework shortly.  I'm particularly proud of my thesis project, 
a UX research and design for a multicultural men's digital marketing space.
