This is a portfolio site that I deisgned and coded using HTML5, CSS, 
Javascript and the Shadowbox.js and Processing.js libraries.

I have linked a variety of my UX, Photography, Graphic Design and other Creative
work to this site.  I'm hoping to reiterate it using the material design thinking
and Materialism css framework shortly.
